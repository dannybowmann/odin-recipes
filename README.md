# odin-recipes
first ever project

After this project I will have demonstrated my knoweledge in writing a html boilerplate, along with filling it with html tags and attributes of paragraphs, images, lists, links, and emphasized text. Also, I will be able to prcatice my terminal git commands along the way to make commits of my project strictly through the command line.
