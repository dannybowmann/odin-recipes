    <p>I've had enough of these entre dishes! It's 
    time for desert, and what better desert to make 
    than the famous lava cake! Lava cake became famous 
    for a reason: It's cakey on the outside with an 
    irresistible center of flowing warm dark chocolate. 
    The first time you try one, it may seem like 
    magic, but this chocolate molten cake recipe 
    is actually quite easy to make and ready in 
    under an hour. Be sure to use high quality 
    chocolate, it will make a huge difference.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients!</h4>
       <ul>
          <li>Butter</li>
          <li>Chocolate</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
          <li>Flour</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
      </ul>
  <br>
    <h4>Instructions!</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Combine the butter and chopped chocolate in a 
          double boiler and melt over low heat, stirring until 
          smooth. Alternatively, place the butter and chocolate 
          in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, 
          stirring every 30-seconds until melted.</li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg 
          yolks, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium speed until 
          thick and pale yellow.</li>
          <li>Add the chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture.</li>
          <li>Fold together the mixture until well combined.</li>
          <li>Transfer the batter into buttered and floured ramekins. 
          Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sides of the cakes 
          are firm set, but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes cool 
          in the ramekins for 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Place a small dessert plate over the top of each 
          ramekin and carefully flip it over, inverting the 
          chocolate lava cake onto the plate. Let stand for about 
          10 seconds, then remove the ramekin to unmold the 
          cakes. Sift powdered sugar on top and garnish with 
          berries, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
