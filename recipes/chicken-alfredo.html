  <br>
    <p>Chicken alfredo is a classic favoriteâ€”a creamy white
    sauce, long strands of pasta mixed with tender pieces of
    lean protein. It sounds so simple - and it is - but yet 
    it is so delicious and will make anyones tastebuds dance 
    on their tounge. This is the kind of dish that you learn 
    how to make once and you'll find yourself making it 
    frequently for the rest of your life!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients!</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>Parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
      </ul>
  <br>
    <h4>Insructions!</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Boil the noodles: Cook the Fettuccine 
        al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken: Season the chicken, then 
        pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a 
        side, or until an internal temperature reaches 
        165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and 
        let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 
        1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while 
        you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li>Make the Alfredo sauce: Using the same pan 
        you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, 
        and seasonings are incorporated and simmered 
        on medium-low heat until thickened, then the 
        Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Assemble: Drain the pasta, reserving 
        some of the liquid to loosen the sauce 
        (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with 
        the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving 
        bowls and top with a few slices of cooked 
        chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, 
        and black pepper if desired.</li>
      </ol>
